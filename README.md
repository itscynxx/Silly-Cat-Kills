# Silly Cat Kills

A mod made for the Northstar client for Titanfall 2

Plays silly cat videos in the top left when getting a kill 

This mod relies on [ClientKillCallback](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/S2Mods/ClientKillCallback/) to function. Without it, the mod's code just won't load.

Videos cannot be moved due to limitations in the Titanfall 2 engine. BIK videos (which this mod uses) must be played from the top left of the screen.
Transparency also doesn't work, meaning you can't just use transparency to move it somewhere else.

Download from the releases tab on GitHub or from [Thunderstore](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/itscynxx/Silly_Cat_Kills/)

## Mod Settings features

- Change video size (up to 600x600 pixels). 500x500 by default.

- Specify a specific video to always be played. All videos are played by default.
